Nathan Thamtoro's Personal Website

Why did I choose MIT license?
- I chose MIT because in terms of this project, I'm not really concerned about people copying me 
since it's just a personal profile project. `MIT license allows others to freely collaborate, distribute,
and modify my code. I think it's right for my project since it's a basic website and I'm open
to see what other developers would change to improve/enhance my website. MIT has very minimal 
restrictions with the only one being a original copyright and license in all copies of the code.
It allows others to easily help my code, or allow my code to be easily accesible for others who may
want help in their website start.
